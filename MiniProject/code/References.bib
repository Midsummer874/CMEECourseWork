abstract = {A procedure for constructing models of population growth is presented. It consists of three assumptions: resource availability changes with population size as a variable, resource supply to a population and population demand for resources function as a field and a boundary, respectively, and the variables move on the field to the boundary. These are organized into an equation similar in form to Verhulst’s model. The equation can determine boundaries necessary for classical models at a certain field. It is shown that most of the models include complex boundaries. The equation also provides a new growth model when the field and boundary are approximated using a linear function and a quadratic function, respectively, of resource availability and population size. One of the parameters in this model is defined as the type and intensity of intraspecific interaction.}

	Abstract = {Several sigmoidal functions (logistic, Gompertz, Richards, Schnute, and Stannard) were compared to describe a bacterial growth curve. They were compared statistically by using the model of Schnute, which is a comprehensive model, encompassing all other models. The t test and the F test were used. With the t test, confidence intervals for parameters can be calculated and can be used to distinguish between models. In the F test, the lack of fit of the models is compared with the measuring error. Moreover, the models were compared with respect to their ease of use. All sigmoidal functions were modified so that they contained biologically relevant parameters. The models of Richards, Schnute, and Stannard appeared to be basically the same equation. In the cases tested, the modified Gompertz equation was statistically sufficient to describe the growth data of Lactobacillus plantarum and was easy to use.}

abstract = {Decrease or growth of population comes from the interplay of death and birth (and locally, migration). We revive the logistic model, which was tested and found wanting in early-20th-century studies of aggregate human populations, and apply it instead to life expectancy (death) and fertility (birth), the key factors totaling population. For death, once an individual has legally entered society, the logistic portrays the situation crisply. Human life expectancy is reaching the culmination of a two-hundred year-process that forestalls death until about 80 for men and the mid-80's for women. No breakthroughs in longevity are in sight unless genetic engineering comes to help. For birth, the logistic covers quantitatively its actual morphology. However, because we have not been able to model this essential parameter in a predictive way over long periods, we cannot say whether the future of human population is runaway growth or slow implosion. Thus, we revisit the logistic analysis of aggregate human numbers. From a niche point of view, resources are the limits to numbers, and access to resources depends on technologies. The logistic makes clear that for homo faber, the limits to numbers keep shifting. These moving edges may most confound forecasting the long-run size of humanity.}

    abstract = "{The Akaike Information Criterion, AIC (Akaike, 1973), and a bias-corrected version, AICC(Sugiura, 1978; Hurvich \\&amp; Tsai, 1989) are two methods for selection of regression and autoregressive models. Both criteria may be viewed as estimators of the expected Kullback-Leibler information. The bias of AIC and AICC is studied in the underfitting case, where none of the candidate models includes the true model (Shibata, 1980, 1981; Parzen, 1978). Both normal linear regression and autoregressive candidate models are considered. The bias of AICC is typically smaller, often dramatically smaller, than that of AIC. A simulation study in which the true model is an infinite-order autoregression shows that, even in moderate sample sizes, AICC provides substantially better model selections than AIC.}",
